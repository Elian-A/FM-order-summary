## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned more about box-shadow
Learned that is better to just do the styling without utility classes at first, is better to get a broad understanding before creating them
_The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming_

### Continued development

My naming should get better, now on I will use the BEM conventions the right way

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Here i found info about box shadows
